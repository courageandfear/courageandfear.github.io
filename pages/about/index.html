				Courage & Fear was started as a side project for the Brazillian-Latino Hip Hop group Los Hombres y Chicas del playa horificado 
				y muy peligroso.

				In 1994 it was purchased by a notoriously eccentric billionaire by the name of Mountefusca Barco. He later
				sold it when his duties as Count of Bola Bola (a small island of the coast of Spain) began taking up too much of his time (circa 
				2009).

				The brand was then abandoned for 4 long years. It was found in a cave by a creature called Gollum, but our proud and noble
				leaders, Lylah Korsu and Adane Byron, quickly won the brand in a game of riddles and have dedicated their time to reviving its
				long dormant powers.
